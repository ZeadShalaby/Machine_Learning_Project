* Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

* It is a data mining technique that transforms raw data into an understandable format. Raw data(real world data) is always incomplete and that data cannot be sent through a model. That would cause certain errors. That is why we need to preprocess data before sending through a model,can help you to score a higher accuracy.

* tkinter:- t is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the ...
